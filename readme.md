#Interview Prep

(Partially from https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)

Go through all of the following questions and think about how you would respond to each. You should be able to answer many of the questions from memory, but you may have to research a few of them.

**Copy this md file to your homework folder and add a short answer under each item.** You should try to be as concise as possible, and list any handy resources you used to answer the question. This will be useful for studying for interviews after class.
