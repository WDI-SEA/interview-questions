## General Questions

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?

Yesterday we learned about using custom filters with angular, and this week we continued to learn more about Angular.js.

* What excites or interests you about coding?

The most exciting thing about coding is building really cool stuff. I love the fact that I can come up with a concept and build it. Building beautiful and functional web applications is what excites me most about coding. 

* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

Recently I participated in a hack-a-thon that used the MEAN stack. Trying to differentiate between the front end and back end using mongo/express/angular/node was very challenging for me. To understand where each piece fit, my team and I pair programmed the back end first by setting up our routes/controllers/databases and then we focused on the front end by building views/controllers. Breaking the problem into smaller pieces really helped me understand the technical arraignment of a MEAN application.

* What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?

When building an application I always put the user experience first. I aim to build websites that not only function correctly but are easy to use. In previous projects I have consulted with an UX designer to refine my site and also have allowed people unfamiliar with the application to test it and give me feedback. 

In terms of security I always make sure that the authentication process is encrypted and unsusceptible to threat. I also write code for edge cases where a user may be trying to hack into an application to make sure that the content of the site is not compromised. 

In terms of maintainability I write code that can be easily read and understood by other developers. My functions, variables, and databases are all named with clear names as to what their functionality is so another developer may pick up where I left of. 

* Talk about your preferred development environment.

I prefer an environment that is open both in terms of layout and communication. I like to work in an environment that has natural background sound or is semi quiet. 

* Which version control systems are you familiar with?

I am familiar with git and github.

* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?
	+ Wireframe front end and data base schema
	+ Start building databases and their relationship
	+ Work the back end, make sure my routes/controllers are grabbing the correct info for the site
	+ Work the front end, set up my views/controllers (depending on the language)
	+ Style the app
	+ Go back and try and break the app, see where the weaknesses are and fix them

* If you have 5 different style sheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?

If I had five different style sheets I would bundle them using a service like kentico to integrate them into my site.

* Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?

Graceful degradation is the idea that you build and app that will run more features on a sophisticated browser and will gradually derogate if you move to a lower level browser. Progressive enhancement is the opposite. You design the bare minimum for the lowest level browser and you progress to higher level browsers you build in more features that they can complete. 

* Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page, without any frameworks (HTML/CSS/JS only).
	+ Create a file in the terminal with an index.html a CS and JS folder with a main.css and app.js respectively
	+ Import pictures into the body of the index.html and style them dimensionally using css
	+ Add a click listener to a button that would cycle through the slideshow photos

* If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?

Angular
